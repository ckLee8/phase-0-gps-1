What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
-- merging branches, resolving conflict, using markdown

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
-- the proper way to push from origin to remote; the use of markdown in Sublime, especially for web links and images; the proper path to an imported element such as an image; the proper way to identify conflicting versions and merge into a single version

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
-- how do I find the path to xxx?
-- Am I in the right branch?
-- amd I pushing to the right repo?

What still confuses you about git?
-- the sheer repetitiveness of the tasks has snared me time and time again. I need to deploy more attention to detail. I also need to gain more practice making pull requests and merging.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
-- Pretty good! I liked Chris's patience and his willingness to google things up while I was troubleshooting. I liked that we got a real sense of achievement as the exercise was drawing to a close.
