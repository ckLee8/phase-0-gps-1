What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I think I struggled most with reconciling files between the feature branch files with the master files. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
THe guide and my peer helped me work through and understand the nuances of merging files and when it was necessary.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked everything from over-arching questions about the assignment as a whole and questions about little efficient shortcuts they use on terminal to save time.

What still confuses you about git?
Not much to be honest. I see why it is so useful in team-based, collaborative projects. The ability to prevent conflict and see changes being made is immensely useful. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Honestly, I was a bit scared going in and nervous, but my guide was really nice and helped me calm down. Did not feel rushed or forced at all.
